# TechDegree-FSJS-Project-06
 Static Node.js and Express Site


This Project was a huge challenge for me , because every singple method that we had to use in this project were all new to me. But I guess I was able to manage all the new awsome lessons and methods that I have learned . although 100% need to practice them more than once , so hopefuly in the last 4 projects we still going to use express and pug and all the skills I was able to claim from Unit6.
thanks to Tree-house.

*changes for styling* : 
color of paragraphs from each section.
background colors.
buttons and transitions
borders.

I really enjoyed the font so I didn't change that one.

*challenges*:
the entire project was a big challenge for me, can't say only at some specific points i was facing a challenge.

*about the project*:
so basically this project was about a portfolio website , which represents project samples along with about me page.  when user clicks any project they should be directed to another page where some description about that project has been explained and also the skills that have been used for it. 

another important part of this project is about errors:
if user type for example /noroute ==> they see 404 error which points at none-exist route.
also an error page it self which is the status 500

both error pages provided with user friendly message and also the status and message will be logged into the console as well.
